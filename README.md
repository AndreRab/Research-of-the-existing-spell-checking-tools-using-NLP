### Description
Research Objective
This study aims to evaluate and compare three spell-checking tools, assessing their effectiveness and accuracy in correcting spelling errors. Using a diverse dataset, we analyze the performance of GPT-4, the language_tool_python library, and a fine-tuned T5 model. Through this study, we aim to identify the most effective tool for spell-checking tasks and explore areas for potential improvement.

The complete analysis and findings are documented in this Jupyter [notebook (jetBrains.ipynb)](https://github.com/AndreRab/Research-of-the-existing-spell-checking-tools-using-NLP/blob/main/jetBrains.ipynb).
